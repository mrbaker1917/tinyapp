# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
Once a user registers or logs in, they can enter a URL and get a six-character TinyURL to use in its place.
They can also edit and delete these TinyURLs. They must be logged in to do anything with the TinyURLs, but a non-logged in
user can access the edit page in order to click the link to the longURL.
